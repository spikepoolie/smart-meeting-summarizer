# ![AI Meeting Summary Generator](./assets/ai-meeting-logo.png) AI Meeting Summary Generator

AI Meeting Summary Generator is a full-stack web application that transcribes, summarizes, and organizes meetings using AI. It helps professionals convert long meetings into concise, structured summaries with key takeaways, action items, and timestamps ‚Äî all powered by OpenAI and LangChain, and built with a modern React + Node.js stack.

This project demonstrates the practical application of large language models (LLMs) in workplace productivity, focusing on speech-to-text integration, summarization pipelines, and real-time feedback.#

## üß† How It Works

1. User uploads audio or pastes meeting transcript
2. The backend transcribes audio (if needed)
3. Sends the text to LangChain pipeline
4. Summarization uses a `ChatPromptTemplate` with OpenAI GPT
5. Receives structured response:
   - List key participants and their roles (if mentioned)
   - Group and summarize main issues or agenda items
   - Include votes, approvals, rejections, or consensus points
   - Who was involved, the topic of dispute, and how it was resolved (if resolved)
   - Include any quotes that reflect key moments or tones
   - List tasks assigned, responsible parties, and deadlines
   - Mention scheduled meetings or deadlines for future discussion
   - Briefly describe the tone (e.g., productive, tense, divided)

The result is formatted and shown in the UI, ready to export or copy.
